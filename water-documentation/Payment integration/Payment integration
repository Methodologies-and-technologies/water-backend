		- app_id — replace it using your application ID "Application main package"

	- (SDKs functions in two modes (Modes should be defined on the configuration of the SDK in the starting of the application)):
		- sandbox - will be used for all of the testing (both manual and automatic)
		- production - will be used for the production because it involves actual transfering real data
