[Main challenge]:
	- In Adjaa Water project we have integration using messaging between APP system and SAP system 
	  which creates additional challenges related to deployment & development of both applications with ensuring data and schema consistency between them.

[Solutions]:
	- define a clear flow of deployment
	- use staging environment for deploying new features and ensuring that both applications work correctly

[Development]:
	- Main environment for the development of the applications. Both SAP and APP can use their own local environments without any restrictions.
	- Related branch for APP repository: develop

[Staging]:
	- Shared environment for APP and SAP which completely duplicates the production environment related to settings.
	  It is required to ensure that integrations between APP and SAP applications are working correctly for newly implemented functionality.

	- New features should stay in the staging environment for 1 - 2 weeks and Dead-Letter-Queues should be monitored for this time to check how many broken messages have happened.

	- If some issues are found hotfixes should be implemented:
		- Discussion between SAP and the APP team to decide which team should fix this issue
		- The selected team provides hot-fix (it should be a task with VERY HIGH priority)
		- The hotfix is deployed to the staging environment where a check is performed that previously failing messages donâ€™t fail anymore
	- Related branch for APP repository: staging

[Production]:
	- The production environment is used by actual users and holds real data. New features should be deployed to this environment only after living for 1 - 2 weeks at the staging environment.
	- Related branch for APP repository: main
